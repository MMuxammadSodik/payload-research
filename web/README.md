# Web Payload Research

## Overview

This directory contains research material, curated payloads, and structured notes related to web application security testing. The purpose of this repository segment is to document practical payload behavior, edge-case discoveries, and exploitation patterns identified during laboratory practice and controlled testing environments.

The focus is on understanding how different web technologies process user input, how filtering mechanisms operate, and how various injection vectors can be analyzed and validated in real-world scenarios.

This directory is intended to evolve into a practical reference base for offensive security engagements and exam preparation.

## Vulnerabilities Covered

The current research scope includes:

- SQL Injection (SQLi)  
  Detection payloads, authentication bypass techniques, union-based extraction patterns, blind injection logic, and filter evasion methods.

- Local File Inclusion (LFI)  
  Path traversal payloads, encoding bypasses, log poisoning concepts, and file disclosure techniques.

- Command Injection  
  Command chaining operators, blind command execution techniques, input filtering bypass methods, and OS-specific payload variations.

- File Upload Vulnerabilities  
  Extension bypass strategies, MIME-type manipulation, polyglot file concepts, and server-side validation weaknesses.

Additional vulnerabilities and exploitation patterns may be added as research progresses.
